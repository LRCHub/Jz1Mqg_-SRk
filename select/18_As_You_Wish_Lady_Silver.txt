I fell in love with the rhythm of a heartbeat,
and every pace plays my life on repeat
And you can tell it's just the way I like my music
A bit of pepper pushing through the sugar sweet

Your name became a song I wish that I had written
So maybe I just thought I want to sing it everyday
Cause once I've spoken to the ever roaming ocean
It told me bout the timeless bond the clouds made with the waves

I'll show you where the sun sets
And take you where the storm is born
Do you wanna fly to where the larks nest?
As you wish, whatever you ask for
As you wish, you got it

I fell in love with the echo of your breathing
The way you place your words on any kind of score
Cause every time I think I surely know that one
You play me something that I've never heard before

I'll show you where the sun sets
And take you where the storm is born
When we can't see just where the world bends
It's sky and ocean blend forevermore
Just look up at where all the stars rest
Pick one and I will name it after you
Do you wanna fly to where the larks nest?
As you wish, whatever you ask for
As you wish, you got it

As you wish, you got it
As you wish, you got it
As you wish, you got it
As you wish, whatever you ask for
You got it.
