Have you noticed how I notice you?
The way the sky reflects off of your eyes
A greenish shade of blue
I love you the way you are

I love what I've seen so far
The only thing I've grown to hate
Is when you doubt the words that I say
Please don't change a thing about you

There's no need to wear make up
When you wake up and I'm where you are
I swear I'll never let you get too far

And I will wait up all night long
I will stay up with you
To say the words it takes to get you through

And when it comes to friendship
I have a small confession
A common misconception
So here's your lesson of the day

I caught feelings for you
While you caught my eye
And now I find that the truth is just too hard to hide
When all I want was in you all along

There's no need to wear make up
When you wake up and I'm where you are
I swear I'll never let you get too far

And I will wait up all night long
I will stay up with you
To say the words it takes to get you through

All night long we'll keep this stereo on
And we will play this song until the break of dawn
All night long we'll keep this stereo on
And we will play this song until the break of dawn

There's no need to wear make up
When you wake up and I'm where you are

There's no need to wear make up
When you wake up and I'm where you are
I swear I'll never let you get too far

And I will wait up all night long
I will stay up with you
To say the words it takes to get you through

All night long we'll keep this stereo on
And we will play this song until the break of dawn
All night long we'll keep this stereo on
And we will play this song until the break of dawn
