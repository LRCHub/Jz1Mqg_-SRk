In a box under my bed
I've kept them
Safe from all the world
And every one
Wished upon in some way
But that never works out

Burning bright then burning out
Disappear and then fall down
Are they special or just broken
Dying or moving on?

Am I always wrong?
Can you see it?
There's another one right there
And it's falling
'Cause it's finished
Being a star
Can you feel it?
Does it mean as much to you?
Honestly (x3)

Am I that wrong?
Is it me every time?
Show me how to take this
As you go on and on
