Rise from ash the phoenix come
With angel eyes that shine for some
All these days of sun
Wait for rain to drum
(Show me)
Say you will
(Finally)
Tried and true reckoned so
To follow means indulge and go
All this life
Not yours or mine
(Show me)
Say you will
(Finally)
Rise from ground
And see all around
Feel you in me
Break the chains from old remains
Running free
Dry your eyes or crystalize, as they will freeze
All these dreams they fell from the stars
From future world's of love
Rise from the ground
See all around
Rise from the ground
See all around
Feel you in me
Rise from the ground
See all around
Rise from the ground
See all around
Feel you in me
